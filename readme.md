# Bevy Sprite3d

Use sprites in a 3d scene.

This was my go-to technique back when I was using Unity. This replicates it in bevy.

Useful for 
- 2d games in a 3d world (perspective camera, mixed 3d sprites and meshes)
- 2d games with easier parallax and scale handling (perspective camera, 3d sprites)
- Purely 2d games that just want to use lighting (orthographic camera, 3d sprites)

# Example

Some more examples. These don't use bevy, but demonstrate the effect style:
